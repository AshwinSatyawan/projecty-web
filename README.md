# Projecty Web
Projecty project management app based on spring.

## Motivation
My main assumption is to create a free and open source focused on privacy project management application for everyone.
I know that project data are really sensitive so you feel better when you are owner of them.
And for those who do not have a server, 
Projecty will be available on the hosted server completely free (in the future).

## Note
App is in early beta versions. It works but layout isn't perfect. My priorities are to develop backend not frontend.

## Getting Started
1. Clone repository

## Contributing
Your contribution is welcome. No matter who you are, you can help anyway.
The most helpful is help with coding but graphic designers are also needed.
If you are not developer or graphic designer don't worry,
you can help with translations, post on blog, make a video, or tell your friend about Projecty.
